Because according to QQ-plot, we can see the relationship between the theoretical quantiles against sample quantiles generated from the model, if the model fits the data well then we expect the plot is close to a 45-degree line. Therefore, I added the 45-degree line to the two plots that found that in Plot B, the points closely align with the 45-degree reference line, indicating a higher degree of agreement between the data and the theoretical **gamma distribution**.
