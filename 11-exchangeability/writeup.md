## Question 1

Exchangeability in statistics and probability means that the order of observations or events doesn't impact their probabilities or likelihood. It's like saying that you can shuffle the sequence without changing the overall chances of different outcomes occurring. 

## Question 2

**Not Exchangeable Example (Resubmitted)**: Imagine I'm choosing two different people for specific roles, such as a president and a vice-president. If I first select Person A as the president and Person B as the vice-president, it's not the same as choosing Person B as the president and Person A as the vice-president. The roles and responsibilities are different, depending on the order in which I assign them. So, in this situation, the order in which I make the selections matters, making it non-exchangeable.

**Exchangeable Example**: If I have a bag with identical red marbles and I draw one, note its color (red), and then return it to the bag before drawing again, my chances of getting a red marble remain the same each time I draw. The order in which I draw the marbles doesn't affect the likelihood of getting a red one. This series of draws is exchangeable.

## Qustion 3

| | A | a | |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|B | yp| p-yp| p |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; row | y | 1-y|  |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; col | y | (p-yp)/(1-p)| |
|b |p-yp  | 1-2p+yp| 1-p|
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; row |(p-yp)/(1-p) |(1-2p+yp)/(1-p) | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; col | 1-y  |(1-2p+yp)/(1-p) | |
| |p | 1-p|1 |

## Question 4

If A and B are independent, then P(AB) = P(A) * P(B)

Therefore, y*p = p*p, since p is not equal to zero, then y = p.

## Question 5

If we choose y = 0.4 and p = 0.6 (which means A and B are not independent), the table should look like this:

| | A | a | |
|:---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|B | 0.24| 0.36| 0.6 |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; row | 0.4 | 0.6|  |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; col | 0.4 | 0.9| |
|b |0.36| 0.04| 0.4|
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; row |0.9 |0.1 | |
| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; col | 0.6  |0.1 | |
| |0.6 | 0.4| 1|
