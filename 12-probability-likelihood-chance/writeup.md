## Question 1 (resubmitted)

Yes, the series will be exchangeable despite the homefield advantage. Even if Team A is more likely to win games when they are at home, the probability of team A winning does not change from game to game, so it remains constant. As a result, the series will be exchageable.

## Question 2

No, the series will still not be exchangeable. This is because the series played in alternating stadiums will still result in the outcomes where teams play in their homefield being higher in probability. For example, given the stadium sequence, the result of ABABA will be more likely than other outcomes given the homefield advantage.

## Question 3

Yes the series will be exchangeable, because even through there's homefield advantage for team A when the game is played in stadium A, the probability of Team A winning still remains constant throughout the whole game, so does Team B's probability of winning when played in their field. This will result in no difference in the ordering of the outcomes, and so the series will be exchangeable.

## Question 4

In the book, it points out that `Probability` refers to the belief, `likelihood` to the uncertainty of a single event under different circumstances, and chance is a concept pertaining to a `Bernoulli` series. Therefore, in this case, 

- Probability: 
1. $P(\theta_i)$. This is the prior probability.
2. $P(\theta_i | \text{ Series outcome is } ABAAA\text{ })$. This represents the conditional probability, which is also the posterior probability.

- Likelihood: $P(\text{Series outcome is } ABAAA\text{ }|\theta_i)$. This represents the likelihood of observing the series outcome "ABAAA" given a specific value of the parameter $\theta_i$. 

- Chance: The $\theta_i$ from the $P(\text{Series outcome is } ABAAA\text{ }|\theta_i)$ stands for "chance" in this equation as it represents the "frequency probability".
