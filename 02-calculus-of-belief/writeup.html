<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h2>Definition of K</h2>
<ol>
<p>'K' in the formula stands for the knowledge base, which is the given condition that the probability of the Event E is calculated upon. The probability depends on the knowledge that a person has at the time of the calculation. The level of knowledge base varies and will affect a person's perception of the probability of a given event. Therefore, the ultimate probability is dependent on two components, the knowledge base and the event itself.</p>
</ol>

<h2>Example of the variation of K</h2>
<ol>
<p>For example, if our event E is to assess the probability of a stock price increasing. Here're possible three different Ks. First is the historical data that indicates, on average, the price increased by 10% annualy over the past decade. Second, K could be a recent news article that states positive earnings results, leading to analysts' expectation of a 5% increase in the stock price for the next month. Third, the capital markets suggest an overall market optimism and a positive in industry by carrying out a regression on the industry that the company resides in, indicating a 8% increase on average. Therefore, the probability of the Event E varies based on different K, where higher probability of K results in a higher prediction of the probability of E.</p>
</ol>

<h2>Definition of E^c</h2>
<ol>
<p>E^c stands for the probaility of the event E not occurring. The lowercased c stands for 'complimentary', and it denotes the complimentary events against the event E. Mathematically, the probability of the complimentary event is equal to one minus the probability of the event E.</p>
</ol>

<h2>P(E is odd)</h2>
<ol>
<p>According to the previous question, since P(E is even) is .6, P(E is odd) must be .4. This is because all possibilities must add up to 1 and P(E is odd) is complimentary to P(E is even).</p>
