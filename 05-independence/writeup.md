# Homework 5: Independence
## Problem 1

Independence means that the probability of one event does not affect the probability of the other. If drink preference and sugar preference are independent, the joint probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

- P(Drink = Colas) = 4/10
- P(Sugar = Regular) = 6/10

If they are independent, the joint probability would be:

P(Estimated Colas & Regular) = P(Colas) * P(Regular) = (4/10) * (6/10) = 24/100 = 0.24

However, the actual P(Colas & Regular) is 0.1 according to the contingency table, which does not match the predicted one if two preferences are independent. 

Therefore, we cannot conclude that drink preference and sugar preference are dependent based on this data.

## Problem 2

To determine the association between a preference for Cola and a preference for regular sugar, we can look at the contingency table and calculate the conditional probabilities.

- P(Regular | Colas) = 1/4
- P(Regular | Not Colas) = 5/6

Given that the conditional probability of regular sugar preference is **lower** when someone prefers Cola (1/4) compared to when they prefer not colas (5/6), it indicates a **negative** association.

In summary, a preference for Cola is negatively associated with a preference for regular sugar because the conditional probability of regular sugar preference is lower among those who prefer Cola compared to those who do not prefer Cola.

## Problem 3

To assess the effectiveness of the more toxic treatment, we can compare the probabilities of experiencing fewer than 3 migraines per month between the two treatments.

- P(Fewer than 3 migraines per month | More toxic treatment) = 3/5 = 0.6
- P(Fewer than 3 migraines per month | Less toxic treatment) = 4/5 = 0.8

In this case, the probability of fewer migraines is lower for the more toxic treatment (0.6 < 0.8), indicating that the less toxic treatment is more effective in reducing the frequency of migraines.
