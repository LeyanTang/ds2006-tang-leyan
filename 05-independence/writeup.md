# Homework 5: Independence
## Problem 1

Independence means that the probability of one event does not affect the probability of the other. 

First, we can look at the conditional probability and compare it to the marginal probability. For example, if the two preferences are independent, P(Sugar Pref|Drink Pref) = P(Sugar Pref), since the drink preference does not indicate the sugar preference.

However, the actual P(Regular|Cola) = 1/4, which is not equal to P(Regular) = 6/10. Therefore, this shows the two preferences are associated.

Alternatively, if drink preference and sugar preference are independent, the joint probability of both events occurring is the product of their individual probabilities.

- P(Drink = Colas) = 4/10
- P(Sugar = Regular) = 6/10

If they are independent, the joint probability would be:

P(Estimated Colas & Regular) = P(Colas) * P(Regular) = (4/10) * (6/10) = 24/100 = 0.24

However, the actual P(Colas & Regular) is 0.1 according to the contingency table, which does not match the predicted one if two preferences are independent. 

Therefore, we cannot conclude that drink preference and sugar preference are independent based on this data.

## Problem 2

To determine the association between a preference for Cola and a preference for regular sugar, we can look at the contingency table and calculate the conditional probabilities.

- P(Regular | Colas) = 1/4
- P(Regular | Not Colas) = 5/6

Given that the conditional probability of regular sugar preference is **lower** when someone prefers Cola (1/4) compared to when they prefer not colas (5/6), it indicates a **negative** association.

In summary, a preference for Cola is negatively associated with a preference for regular sugar because the conditional probability of regular sugar preference is lower among those who prefer Cola compared to those who do not prefer Cola.

## Problem 3

In this specific scenario, if we only rely on conditional probabilities to judge treatment effectiveness, it might not give us a reliable assessment. Conditional probabilities help us understand the chances of improvement based on the type of treatment someone receives, but they don't prove a direct cause-and-effect connection between the treatment and the actual outcomes.

One major concern would be the selection bias. This happens when people with more severe conditions tend to choose the more aggressive treatment. As a result, the conditional probabilities may not purely reflect how effective the treatment is, but rather, they could be influenced by the fact that people with more severe problems naturally end up in the more intensive treatment group.

In summary, while conditional probabilities provide some insights, they might not be enough to tell us if the treatment is genuinely effective because they can be skewed by factors like selection bias. Additionally, it's worth noting that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. To get a more solid understanding, we'd need to consider additional research methods and data analysis.
